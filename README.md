# Isabel &amp; Georgia's Final Project for CLPS 0950

In the game Hearts, 4 players go in a circle playing 1 card each for each round, also known as a “trick.” The game begins with whoever has the 2 of clubs in their hand if 13 cards. The other three players must follow suit if possible, or they can play any other suit if they cannot follow. The person who plays the numerically highest card of the starting shit collects the trick and starts the next one. Hearts cannot be played to start a trick unless they have already been ‘broken’- played in a previous trick. The only exception is if the person initializing the trick only has hearts to play. The goal is to collect as few hearts as possible when taking tricks, as they are worth one point each. Additionally, the queen of spades is worth 13 points and is the main thing to avoid. Points are cumulatively added over multiple games according to player preference.
